1. **Closure** : If a biochemical datum is digitized and non-proprietary - you should be able to get it. One API, one schema.  
Medicine, biotechnology, ecology, human assays into the fabric of life in general are ultimately attempts to engineer a "better" outcome, if purely through prognostication at times. Such attempts are motivated by intelligent co-observation of events which belong to different temporal and physical scales. The accessibility and quality of these connections would come to distinguish engineering from hacking in life-sciences of the future. 

2. **Common Ontology** : Closure enables complete indexing and a singular namespace. This allows integration of wildly heterogenous data up to a ```pd```-dataframe/```np```.shape/whatever is next.  
    A common ontology precludes a connected graph. In "life-sciences", nominally disconnected fields are investigating the output of a single master-algorithm. Casting the data acquired by every field to a common [biological assembly](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/biological-assemblies) would provide a common context for each. More lucid communication between them and broader hypothesis generation will ensue.


I believe that poor data-integration is something that plagues all bio-scientific disciplines that accumulate any sizeable data. It is also subtle in its ubiquity: though both the evolutionary geneticist and bioelectricity researcher may be attending to the mechanisms of morphogenesis or tumour formation, it is hardly the case that there is ample communication between their respective fields and hence fewer investemnet in the ontologies that bridge them. By the same token and to a larger extent, most software is designed for a very specific purpose and is insulated in the space of adjacet datatypes, lab-specific practices and instruments that bear it. 

**Why? This would facilitate:**:

- *DNN Models that span verticals* in addition to horizontals. Causality in biology is notoriously hard to establish due to 2-way interactions between physical and structural scales, emergence. Models that learn from multiple scales/modalities of data have the potential to glean interactions that are not represented in the teleologically selected data. Overparametrization is a blessing that has to be capitalized upon.
  
- *Spanning graph databases* [will elaborate].

- *Distributed mining*  [will elaborate].
