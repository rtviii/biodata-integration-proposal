1. **Closure** : If a biochemical datum is digitized and non-proprietary - you should be able to get it. One API, one schema.  
Medicine, biotechnology, ecology, human assays into the fabric of life in general are ultimately attempts to engineer a "better" outcome, if purely through prognostication at times. Such attempts are motivated by intelligent co-observation of events which belong to different temporal and physical scales. The accessibility and quality of these connections would come to distinguish engineering from hacking in life-sciences of the future. 

2. **Common Ontology** : Closure enables complete indexing and a singular namespace. This allows integration of wildly heterogenous data up to a ```pd```-dataframe/```np```.shape/whatever is next.  
    A common ontology precludes a connected graph. In "life-sciences", nominally disconnected fields are investigating the output of a single master-algorithm. Casting the data acquired by every field to a common [biological assembly](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/biological-assemblies) would provide a common context for each. More lucid communication between them and broader hypothesis generation will ensue.


**Why? This would facilitate:**:

- *Models that span verticals* in addition to horizontals. Causality in biology is notoriously hard to establish due to 2-way interactions between physical and structural scales, emergence. Models that learn from multiple scales/modalities of data have the potential to glean interactions that are not represented in the teleologically selected data. Overparametrization is a blessing that has to be capitalized upon.
