
[ In the long run, we'd like to be able to access multiple bionformatics resources from the same place with little friction and high integration between the fetched data.
Say, wouldn't it be great if it also encapsulated the meaningless data-cleaning and formatted the targets into the shape appropriate for the experiment before arrival. Why, yes it would.]


#### We wish for an interface to life that has:

1. **Closure** : If a biochemical datum is digitized and non-proprietary - you should be able to get it. One API, one schema.  
Medicine, biotechnology, ecology, human assays into the fabric of life in general are ultimately attempts to engineer a "better" outcome, if purely through prognostication at times. Such attempts are informed by intelligent observation of events which are more often than not belong to different temporal and physical scales. The accessability and quality of these connections would come to distinguish engineering from hacking in life-sciences of the future. 

2. **Common Ontology** : Closure enables complete indexing and a singular namespace. This allows integration of wildly heterogenous data up to a ```pd```-dataframe/```np```.shape/whatever is next.  
    A common ontology precludes a connected graph. Nominally disconnected life-sciences fields are investigating the output of a single master-algorithm. Casting the data acquired by every sub-field to a common [biological assembly](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/biological-assemblies) would provide the context for each, enable communication and transdisciplianry hypothesis generation. 


**Why? This would facilitate:**:

- *Models that span verticals* in addtion to horizontals. Causality in biology is notoriously hard to establish due to 2-way interactions between physical and structural scales, emergence. Models that learn from multiple scales/modalities of data have the potential to glean interactions that are not represented in the teleologically selected data. Overparametrization is a blessing that has to be capitalized upon.
