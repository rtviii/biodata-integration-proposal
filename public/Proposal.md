
[ In the long run, we'd like to be able to access multiple bionformatics resources from the same place with little friction and high integration between the fetched data.

Say, wouldn't it be great if it also encapsulated the meaningless data-cleaning and formatted the targets into the shape appropriate for the experiment before arrival. Why, yes it would.][*](#auditory)


#### We wish for an interface to life that has:

1. **Closure** : one shoudl be abel to *just fetch* any biochemical datum from the space of public repositories with a single query. 
If its digitized and non-proprietary - you should be able to get it. 

2. **Common Ontology** : Closure enables complete indexing and a singular namespace. You should be able to **integrate heterogenous data** up to a ```pd```-dataframe/```np```.shape/whatever's next: if ***it***'s available but *also* ***its subunits*** are available, and *also* ***its subunits' ```.cif``` models*** are available and *also*... - you should be able to get it. A common ontology precludes a connected graph.
