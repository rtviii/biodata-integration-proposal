
In the long run, we'd like to be able to **access multiple bionformatics resources from the same place** with little friction and high integration betwen the fetched data. A meta-```curl```.

Say, wouldn't it be great if it also encapsulated some of the meaningless **data-cleaning** that we are doing right now and formatted the targets **into the shape that we need** for the experiment even before arrival. Why, yes it would.


#### We wish for an interface to biology that has:

1. **Closure** : *just fetch* any biochem-datum from the space of public repositories with a single query. If *it*'s digitized and non-proprietary - you should be able to get it.


2. **Common Ontology** : Closure enables complete indexing and a singular namespace. Hence, if ***it***'s available but *also* ***its subunits*** are available, and *also* ***its subunits' ```.cif``` models*** and *also*...- you should be able to get it.A common ontology enables us to **integrate heterogenous data** up to a ```pd```-dataframe/```np```.shape/whatever's next.
