There is an attempt underway to build a database that relies on [Neo4J ](https://neo4j.com/) graph engine and GraphQL at the moment that has hooks into the structural data as well as the semantic. Seeing if this idea of bridging can actually work.

If you know of a domain/area/subfield where this idea-- where there is a palpable disconnect between the semantic and the concrete for example -- and this idea can fit well, please consider getting in touch!

*It doesn't \*really\* matter which slice of the biochemical "stack" you are dealing with (-omics/expression atlases/crystallographic files/sequences/...) or which format your data is in. If this to be a useful exercise, span should be the goal.*

### Since my first posting this around christmas 2018:

+ 
+ 2019 PDB Rutgers  have added a [ GraphQL  wrapper](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/webservices) for their API.
+ 2020 PDBE is are alsostarting to use the Neo4j graph database, [ offering devloper training therein ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2020/mining-pdbe-and-pdbe-kb-using-graph-database).
+ A 2020 community-driven [ proposal ](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-278/v1) calling for integration of data and tools in ELIXIR.

##### I realize that at this point it might not seem obviously useful to a professional biologist, who already has her heuristics for putting computations together figured out, or a professional data-scientist for whom this would fall naturally into the "data-cleaning" category of the paycheck. Still, there are things to be said for a slightly bigger picture.
