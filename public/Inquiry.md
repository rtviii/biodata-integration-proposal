## I'd love to hear about your suboptimal experience in dealing with families of bioinformatics/biochemistry resources:
 - an API/Database's GUI doesn't allow for *high-volume* data-fetching
 - an API seems *poorly documented* or just became *obscure or obsolete* over the years (bindings for older languages, outdated format specifications, labyrinthine endpoints)
 - the mappings are unsatisfactory between the two APIs (there are *reproducible inconsistencies* between same data different sources provide)
 - the shape you need lies on the intersection of *mutually-exclusive ontologies*
 - the API/Database doesn't serve the data the *format* you'd prefer 
 - the resource is isolated in any other sense (weak interoperability; no obvious mappings to other relevant resources or schemas) 
In this case, please drop us a line and we just might scratch your itch as well:


*It doesn't matter which **slice of** the biochem-**stack** you are dealing with (-omics/expression dictionaries/cryo-em models/sequences/..) or which **format** your case conforms to (fp-arrays/text/dictionary/time-series) -- we'd still love to hear about it*: [ ```rtkushner@gmail.com``` ](mailto:rtkushner@gmail.com?subject=Biological+Data+Integration)

Thank you!


Ex. PDB Rutgers said that they are developing a [GraphQL](#https://graphql.org/) wrapper for their API and their [ beta ](http://beta.rcsb.org/pages/webservices) is up sometimes.

###### *I realize that this might not actually be immediately useful to either professional biologists, who already have their heuristics developed and delivery pipelines figured out, or professional data-scientist for whom another layer of scripting on top of the usual data-cleaning might not seem so unnatural. In fact, i'd like to hear from an audience in-between insofar as it exists. And insofar as it doesn't reasons for why it can't.  

###### *Likewise, i'm perfectly (painfully) aware of the complexity that something like that incurs in the limit. Contra certain responses along the lines of "impossible due to cost/complexity", to me it's obvious that -- in the limit -- any costs are be paid for by the appropriate demand:  infrastsructure has to materialize eventually and there ain't nothig but to do it.
